## 3.2 Code Quality
#### *How would you describe "good code"? What role (if any) do comments, refactoring, and code reviews play?*

In my opinion, a good code is something that a non-coder/tech person can look over and still be able to understand at least on the high level what's going on. A good code should  require minimal comments as the name of the classes, properties, interfaces etc should be self-descriptive or self-explanatory. But there are certain cases where comments would be required. For example, if the comment is referencing a future enhancement, an external source or a workaround and also if its for refactoring a pre-exisiting unoptimized code. 

Refactoring is a very important process of software development and it makes the code more performant and manageable. Refactoring is a strategy to achieve "good code" however there are trade-offs if dealing with time constraints and project deadline. If you find yourself refactoring too much then its time to revisit your software development strategy and consult your tech lead/architect. An effective software architecture will require less refactoring since you have started on the right foot from the start. Sometimes, due to security updates and breaking changes a developer might have to update their code in which case a detail project upgrade document should be created to estimate the impact accross the infrastructure and business processes. 

Code Review is a significant part of software development methodologies and should be adopted by most team regardless of their size and function. Code Review and Peer Programming are the two greatest factors that help improve code and also the skill of the developer. Based on my past experience, some developers are hesitant or defensive when it comes to code review and think its a way of finding faults in the code. Even though code review allows to find faulty code its not the main objective. The main goal of a code review is to look at code from a different developer perspective while providing constructive criticism. An effective code review is when all developers involved benefit from the changes while having a strong sense of team collaboration. 

Therefore, the concept of good code is subjective and there are proven guidelines from reverred developers and companies which facilitate in developing a strong code convention within the engineering team. A good code is code that is efficient, manageable, code-reviewed , extensible and easy to read.
